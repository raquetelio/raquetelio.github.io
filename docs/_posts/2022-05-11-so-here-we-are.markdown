Yeah! This is the day I stopped having an idea in mind, waiting for the best moment to plan the perfect delivery. Instead, I just took it over for execution and started doing. 

I will spend some time learning more about Jekyll's features and then will start publishing content that, hopefully, is useful for someone else, or just for my future self.

Keep tuned please!
